# Igniter.js MCP Server

## Overview

The **Igniter.js MCP Server** transforms your project into an AI-native development platform. Unlike traditional frameworks that were built for humans, Igniter.js was designed from the ground up to be understood and utilized by AI agents through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Think of it as giving your AI coding assistant X-ray vision into your entire project. Instead of making educated guesses about your code, AI agents can actually *ask* your codebase questions and get real, accurate answers.

## What Makes This Revolutionary?

Most AI coding tools today are sophisticated autocomplete systems. They pattern-match against billions of lines of code to predict what you probably want to write next. But with Igniter.js MCP Server, your AI agent develops actual understanding of your project architecture, data flow, business logic, and the relationships between features.

This isn't just about code completion—it's about having an intelligent conversation with your codebase.

## Tools

The Igniter.js MCP Server exposes a comprehensive set of tools that give AI agents deep insight into your project:

## Sample Prompts

Once connected to your MCP-compatible AI agent, you can have natural conversations about your project:

### Project Analysis
- "Analyze the user authentication feature and show me any potential issues"
- "What are all the API endpoints and their current health status?"
- "Show me the dependency chain for the user management system"

### Development Tasks
- "Generate a new user management feature with authentication"
- "Create a controller for handling payment processing in the billing feature"
- "Build the project for production and show me any errors"

### Code Understanding
- "Explain how the payment processing flow works in this codebase"
- "What would break if I refactor the User model to use a different ID type?"
- "Show me all the places where authentication might fail"

### Collaborative Development
- "Delegate the API testing task to a Claude agent and monitor progress"
- "What patterns has the team learned about error handling in this project?"
- "Store this architectural decision about why we chose this database structure"

## Integrating with AI Tools

AI tools have different ways of integrating MCP servers. The configuration contains a command for starting the server that'll be executed by the respective tool.

### Cursor

#### Add via Cursor Settings UI
- Open **Cursor Settings**
- Select **MCP** in the settings sidenav  
- Click **+ Add new global MCP server**
- Add the Igniter.js configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Igniter": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@igniter-js/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Project Configuration
For project-specific configuration, create `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Igniter": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["@igniter-js/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "IGNITER_PROJECT_ROOT": "."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code Copilot

Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "Igniter": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@igniter-js/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Windsurf

Add via **Windsurf Settings** > **Cascade** > **Add Server**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Igniter": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@igniter-js/mcp-server"]  
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop

Create the configuration file:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Igniter": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@igniter-js/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code (Terminal)

```bash
claude mcp add igniter npx @igniter-js/mcp-server
```

## The AI-Native Advantage

### Beyond Code Completion

Traditional AI coding assistants are pattern-matching systems. Igniter.js MCP Server enables true understanding:

- **Architectural Awareness**: Your AI agent understands your project's structure and design decisions
- **Business Logic Context**: It knows your domain rules and can apply them to new features
- **Impact Analysis**: It can predict what breaks when you change something
- **Memory Persistence**: It remembers your conversations and architectural decisions

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Why stop at one AI agent? With Igniter.js MCP Server, you can orchestrate teams of specialized agents:

- **Research Agents** that excel at understanding requirements
- **Implementation Agents** that write clean, maintainable code  
- **Testing Agents** that focus on quality assurance
- **Documentation Agents** that keep everything up to date

Each agent has access to the same rich context about your project but can focus on what they do best.

### The Network Effect

As more developers use Igniter.js with MCP, the entire ecosystem becomes smarter. Successful patterns get reinforced, common problems get solved once and shared, and the framework evolves based on real usage from thousands of AI-assisted development sessions.

## Getting Started Today

The future of AI-native development isn't some distant vision—it's available right now. Every Igniter.js starter comes with MCP Server pre-configured and ready to use with your favorite AI coding assistant.

Create your first AI-native project:

```bash
npx create-igniter@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

Then connect your preferred AI agent and start having real conversations with your codebase.

## Real-World Impact

**Week 1**: Instead of spending hours understanding authentication patterns, ask your AI agent. It analyzes your codebase and explains the architectural decisions and security considerations.

**Month 1**: Need to refactor a critical component? Your AI agent predicts exactly what will break, suggests migration strategies, and helps write the migration scripts.

**Month 3**: New team member joins? Your AI agent gives them a personalized tour of the codebase, explaining business logic and architectural decisions specific to your project.

**Month 6**: Planning a major feature? Your AI agent analyzes the entire codebase, identifies potential conflicts, suggests improvements, and helps break work into manageable tasks.

This isn't about replacing developers—it's about giving developers superpowers. It's about turning every development session into a collaborative conversation with intelligent agents who understand your code as well as you do.
