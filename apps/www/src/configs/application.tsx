      question: "What makes Igniter.js different from other frameworks?",
      answer:
        "Igniter.js is designed specifically for modern TypeScript applications with a focus on end-to-end type safety, AI friendliness, and developer experience. Unlike traditional frameworks, it provides fully-typed RPC communication, works seamlessly across different runtimes, and offers built-in real-time capabilities and background jobs without complex setup.",

It's built on standard Web Request and Response APIs, so it integrates seamlessly with your existing tech stack without requiring major architectural changes.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the end-to-end type safety work?",
      answer:
        "Igniter.js leverages TypeScript's type system to provide compile-time guarantees across your entire application. When you define your API on the server, the client automatically gets fully-typed methods with IntelliSense and auto-completion. No schemas to share, no code generation - just pure TypeScript magic.",
    },

    },
    {
      question: "What about Code Agents and developer experience?",
      answer:
        "Igniter.js is designed for the future of development where humans and AI collaborate. The predictable structure, clear conventions, feature-sliced architecture, and comprehensive type system create a low-entropy environment that both developers and AI agents can easily understand and modify.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get started with Igniter.js?",
