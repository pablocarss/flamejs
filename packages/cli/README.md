The official Command-Line Interface (CLI) for the Igniter.js framework. This tool is designed to enhance developer productivity by automating common tasks like project scaffolding and running the development server.

## Role in the Ecosystem

The `@igniter-js/cli` package is a key part of the Igniter.js developer experience. It provides a set of simple commands that handle complex setup and execution processes, allowing you to focus on writing code instead of configuring boilerplate.

## Usage

The recommended way to use the CLI is via `npx`, which ensures you are always using the latest version without needing a global installation.

```bash
npx @igniter-js/cli <command>
```

## Commands

The CLI provides two main commands to manage your project's lifecycle.

### `igniter init`

The `init` command scaffolds a new, production-ready Igniter.js project from scratch. It runs an interactive setup wizard that configures your project structure, dependencies, and optional features like the Store and Queues.

**Example:**
```bash
# Create a new project in a directory named 'my-api'
npx @igniter-js/cli init my-api
```

For more details, see the **[igniter init documentation](https://igniterjs.com/docs/cli-and-tooling/igniter-init)**.

### `igniter dev`

The `dev` command starts the Igniter.js development server. It watches your files for changes and provides hot-reloading. Its most powerful feature is the interactive mode.

**Example:**
```bash
# Start the development server in interactive mode
igniter dev --interactive

# Start the server and manage the Next.js dev server alongside it
igniter dev --interactive --framework nextjs
```

For more details, see the **[igniter dev documentation](https://igniterjs.com/docs/cli-and-tooling/igniter-dev)**.
